# Plug-Flow-Reactor-Simulation
MATLAB simulation of adiabatic plug flow reactor (PFR) for acetone cracking This project models the irreversible vapor-phase cracking of acetone in an adiabatic PFR using first-order kinetics. It includes thermochemical calculations, temperature and conversion profiles, and the effect of nitrogen dilution, pressure variation on reactor performance.
